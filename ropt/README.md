# roPT
ROPT is a real-time safety-aware routing system that detects when people enter restricted zones and automatically re-routes robots to avoid unsafe paths. It turns perception into semantic safety events, updates a workspace graph in real time, and computes new routes under tight latency constraints using dynamic forbidden edges and risk penalties.
